# üõ°Ô∏è PowerShell Threat Feed Scanner

A lightweight PowerShell script that scans your system‚Äôs **active TCP connections** and compares them to **real-time malicious IPs** from [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/).

Built for blue teamers, SOC analysts, and cybersecurity students looking to practice threat hunting using native Windows tools.

---

## Features

- Fetches live threat intelligence IPs from abuse.ch (URLhaus)
- Lists active outbound TCP connections (`Get-NetTCPConnection`)
- Detects and flags matches with known malicious IPs
- Saves suspicious matches to a report file on the desktop
- **NEW:** Optional geolocation enrichment (ThreatFeedScanner-Geo.ps1) using ip-api.com

---

## How to Test It

First, **open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges**.

Then use it to simulate a match with a known malicious IP from the URLhaus feed by running the following **PowerShell one-liner**:

```powershell
$r = New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient; $r.Connect("200.59.83.63", 50623); Start-Sleep 10; $r.Close()
```

**This command will give you 10 seconds to simulate a connection** to a malicious IP and port of your choice (e.g. one you found in the URLhaus feed), long enough for the script to detect it in a scan. The connection is then **safely closed automatically**.

While the connection is still active, **open a second PowerShell terminal (also as administrator)** and run your script:

```powershell
.\ThreatFeedScanner.ps1
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not download or interact with content** from these IPs. This test only opens a temporary TCP connection (using `TcpClient`) for detection by the script, no data is transmitted or received.

## Usage

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Athanasios-Oikonomopoulos/PowerShell-Threat-Feed-Scanner.git
cd PowerShell-Threat-Feed-Scanner
.\ThreatFeedScanner.ps1
```

- The script will fetch the feed, scan your active connections, and log any hits.
- You‚Äôll find the log file here:
  ```
  C:\Users\<YourName>\Desktop\ThreatIntelMatches.txt
  ```

## üåç New Version: ThreatFeedScanner-Geo.ps1 (with Geolocation Feature)

In addition to the original scanner, a new script `ThreatFeedScanner-Geo.ps1` is available.  
It works the same way as `ThreatFeedScanner.ps1` but adds **IP geolocation enrichment** using the free [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com) service.

### How it works
- Detects active connections against the URLhaus feed (same as original).
- For each matched IP, queries ip-api.com and retrieves:
  - Country, Region, City
  - ISP and Organization
  - Latitude & Longitude
- Saves results to a timestamped log file on the Desktop, with geolocation metadata included.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: ip-api.com free tier allows ~45 requests per minute. If your scan finds many matches, results may be rate-limited. Consider adding a short Start-Sleep between lookups or using a paid/HTTPS provider for higher limits.
